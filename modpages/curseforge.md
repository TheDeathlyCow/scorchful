# Features

**Scorchful**  is a Vanilla+ survival mod focused on Heat and Desert Survival. This mod increases the difficulty of the survival experience in warm biomes and The Nether.

## Keeping Wet and Staying Cool

Scorchful makes exposure to **the Sun** more dangerous in the warm areas of the world like Jungles, Deserts, Savannas, and Badlands. When outside the protection of Shade, you will grow warmer over time. As you get warmer, you will face the increasing effects of heatstroke: including weakness, hunger, and mining fatigue.

Overcome the heat by **Staying Wet**. You can go for a dip in the pond or river, or even just dunk a bucket of water on yourself. If you drink water from Potions, Water Bottles, certain foods, or the new **Water Skin** and **Cactus Juice**, you are also able to **Sweat**, which provides the same cooling benefit as being wet!

## Enhanced Nether Survival

The Nether is an extreme environment that brings many new perils. It is hotter than even the warmest places of the Overworld, which means water cannot remain in its liquid form so easily there. To stay cool, you will need to carry your own water with you to drink, or you can make use of the **Nether Lillies** found in the Crimson Forest, Warped Forest, and occasionally the Nether Wastes.

**Crimson Lillies** evolved in the harsh conditions of The Nether to have large root systems that can absorb the scant moisture from the surrounding Netherrack. They collect and use this moisture as a weapon against many of the Fire-born monsters of The Nether that might threaten it. While this may be an effective defense against many of the native inhabitants of The Nether, it is quite useful to us! Step on the Crimson Lillies for a quick soak, or harvest the water of the more tame **Warped Lillies** for long-distance Nether traversal.

## Sandstorms

**Sandstorms** now form in Deserts and Badlands during weather events. When this happens, a thick sand fog will envelop the player, reducing their visibility but also blocking the heat of the Sun. This is not just a visual effect though. During sandstorms, **Sand Piles** will begin to accumulate and exposed Cauldrons will also fill with sand, creating **Renewable Sand**.

## Combat and Future Plans

This first release of Scorchful focuses primarily on the Survival aspects of the mod. However, there are still some light combat elements. Setting mobs and players on fire is another way to warm them up very quickly - making extinguishing the fire very important! Splash Potions will also wet players, allowing for another quick way of soaking yourself in combat.

The next update for the mod will feature **The Mirage**, a hostile Desert Wraith that is attracted to heat. You can follow along with and give feedback on The Mirage's development [here](https://github.com/theDeathlyCow/scorchful/discussions/20).

# Permissions

Scorchful is licensed under LGPLv3. You can use this mod in mod packs, YouTube videos, or anything else. However, I do ask that you do not redistribute it without my explicit permission and a link back to the original CurseForge, Modrinth, and GitHub pages.

# Configuration

Scorchful is extremely highly configurable. It has an extensive config that lets you play around with different settings, disable features, or tweak the values of various things to adjust the difficulty of the mod. For example, if you're not all that into survival, but still wanna try out Sandstorms or have heat effects from Fire, you can completely disable passive heating! It also has a fair amount of datapack integrations with data-driven temperature effects and tags for things like Heat Resistance on armor and water from food and drink. The wiki has all of the detail, so be sure to read that when delving into config for Scorchful: https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/scorchful/wiki/Config

# Mod Integrations

Scorchful is designed to work alongside [Frostiful](https://modrinth.com/mod/frostiful), as its heat-focused sister mod. It has also out-of-the-box integration for [Dehydration](https://modrinth.com/mod/dehydration). Additionally, [Thermoo Patches](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermoo-patches) offers a suite of integration patches for many other mods, such as Origins Fabric Seasons, Colorful Hearts, Overflowing Bars, Armor Points++, Ad Astra, and more!


* [Frostiful](https://modrinth.com/mod/frostiful): Scorchful has native support for Frostiful, and both mods are designed to work alongside each other. I highly recommend using both!
* [Dehydration](https://modrinth.com/mod/dehydration): If Dehydration is enabled, Scorchful will automatically disable the built-in thirst system and use Dehydration's instead.
* [Colorful Hearts](https://modrinth.com/mod/colorful-hearts) & [Overflowing Bars](https://modrinth.com/mod/overflowing-bars): Burning Hearts render on top of the new hearts from these mods. However, engulfed hearts currently do not work.
* [Enchantment Descriptions](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchantment-descriptions): A description is provided for the Rehydration enchantment for Armor.
* [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets): The Sun Hat can be worn in the Hat slot, and provides the same benefits as when equipped in the regular head slot.
* [Farmer's Delight](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight-fabric): Foods and Drinks from Farmer's Delight have been integrated to provide water, where it makes sense to do so.
* [Ad Astra](https://modrinth.com/mod/ad-astra): Netherite Space Suits provide Heat Resistance.

### Compatibility

While this mod is designed to be as compatible as possible with other mods, sometimes issues will inevitably arise. Specific incompatibilities will be documented here and on the [wiki](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/scorchful/wiki#compatibility) as they become known.

* [Tough as Nails](https://modrinth.com/mod/tough-as-nails) -- Incompatible due to multiple temperature bars and no integration for its thirst mechanic. No real point in using these mods together anyway when Frostiful exists!
* [PyroFrost](https://modrinth.com/mod/pyrofrost) -- PyroFrost has a temperature system different from Scorchful/Thermoo, so you will have 2 temperature bars.
* [EnvironmentZ](https://modrinth.com/mod/environmentz) -- Same as PyroFrost.
* [Thermite](https://modrinth.com/mod/thermite) -- Same as PyrFrost.
* Most shader packs will likely break the fog effects in a Desert or Badlands during a sandstorm, but the other effects (particles, sand piles, and cauldrons) will still work as normal.
